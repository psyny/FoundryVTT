### Disclaimer

This features of this module was first part of my (Cozy Player)[https://github.com/psyny/FoundryVTT/tree/master/CozyPlayer] module. I've decided to make this a separate module to make it work with other systems beyond Dungeons And Dragons.

If FVTT adds windows and other interactibles I plan to update this module to support it.

## Installation
* Open the Foundry application and click **"Install Module"** in the **"Add-On Modules"** tab.
* Paste the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyny/FoundryVTT/master/ArmsReach/arms-reach/module.json
* Click "Install"
* Activate the module in your World using **Manage Modules** under the **Game Settings** tab.

## Usage
The iteraction distance is measure by the distance between a token and the door. So, to iteract with a door, the player need to have a token selected (or own a token).

## Features
* Enable the GM to select the maximum distancce that players can interact with a door (needs a token selected) (DM bypass this limitation)
* Pressing 'e' opens/closes a door nearest of current selected token
* Holding 'e' centers the camera on current selected token

## Known issues
None up until now.
